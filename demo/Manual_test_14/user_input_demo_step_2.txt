1. I pick [375,482] because it seems to be an actual corner of the fabric and pulling it away from the center point can help unflatten the fabric.

2. The previous picking pixel is [567,424], and it's symmetric point's pixel is [291,290]. The chosen picking point is not within the 100 pixel range of those two points, thus it's not near to those two points.

3. The center point is at [429,357], the chosen picking point is at [375,482]. The center point is to the 1/4 * pi of the picking point,the direction starting from the center point to the picking point is 5/4 * pi.

4. Since the direction starting from the center point to the picking point is 5/4 * pi, I will pick 5/4 * pi as my moving direction.


1. Pick point: [375,482]
2. Moving direction: 5/4*pi
3. Moving distance: 0.5
