1. I pick [365,277] because it seems to be an actual corner of the fabric and pulling it away from the center point can help unflatten the fabric.

2. No previous picking point information is given.


3. The center point is at [358,362], the chosen picking point is at [365,277]. The center point is to the 6/4 * pi of the picking point,the direction starting from the center point to the picking point is 2/4 * pi.

4. Since the direction starting from the center point to the picking point is 2/4 * pi, I will pick 2/4 * pi as my moving direction.




1. Pick point: [365,277]
2. Moving direction: 2/4*pi
3. Moving distance: 0.5
