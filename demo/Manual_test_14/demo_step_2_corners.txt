This is the coverage of the cloth now:0.847
I am providing you the processed image of the current situation of the cloth to be smoothened. The blue points that you can see is the corners detected by Shi-Tomasi corner detector and here is their corresponding pixel:

The corners are :[[569 ,427],[291 ,318],[468 ,227],[353 ,488],[332 ,312],[288 ,345],[309 ,358],[375 ,482],[397 ,475],[420 ,468]]

And the black point represents the center point of the cloth which is the center point of the cloth's bounding box. Its pixel is [429, 357]

The red points are the pick point chosen last time and its symmetric point. Its pixel is [567,424], and it's symmetric point's pixel is [291,290]. It's advised to pick points that are not near those two points.

Judging from the input image and the pixel coordinates of the corners and center point, please making the inference following the strategy and output the result using the required format.
